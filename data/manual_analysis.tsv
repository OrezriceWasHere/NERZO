War	french and indian war	1	"During the French and Indian War, Killbuck had assisted the English against their French enemy. In 1761, Killbuck led an English supply train from Fort Pitt to Fort Sandusky. When The American Revolution began, Killbuck found his people caught between the English in the West and the Americans in the East. At the war's beginning, Killbuck and many Lenape claimed to be neutral. In 1778, Killbuck permitted American soldiers to traverse Delaware territory so that the soldiers could attack Fort Detroit. In return, Killbuck requested that the Americans build a fort near the Natives' major village of Coshocton to provide the Delaware with protection from English attacks. The Americans agreed and built Fort Laurens, which they garrisoned."

As the CPI was formed after the merger of the People's War Group and the Maoist Communist Centre of India, Roopesh had a lot to act with behind his back, as they brought fear to the ruling class in what they were putting together. They want to carry out this revolution with violence by making big statements and big acts. They have already killed many innocent people in India and still are."

Vehicle	autogyro	1	"The Cierva C.6 prototype was fitted with ailerons mounted on two small wings, also with elevators and a rudder. This complete three-axis control scheme was needed because the pilot had only limited control over the rotor. Only the front propeller was powered, so this aircraft could not hover, and could lose control at low speed. The vertical axis rotor spun freely; the faster the autogyro flew, the faster the rotor would spin and the greater lift it produced."

Roger's advance party engaged in a similar number which preceded a force in excess of 800 men out from Île aux Noix. The Rangers managed to ambush them and the French were beaten off. Realising the numbers Rogers quickened his march, so much so that the French prisoners could not keep up pace so Rogers ordered their breeches cut off so their pace could quicken. Having arrived at Windmill Point, Rogers sent the prisoners and a contingent of fifty soldiers along with his intelligence report to Crown Point, Rogers and the rest of the men waited for Holmes' force."

Band	swans	1	"The band's lineup and sound evolved over time, and their music became somewhat more conventional. A marked shift in Swans' music came with inclusion of Gira's partner, Jarboe, who added her ethereal voice and synthesizers to the group in 1985. Gira and Swans spent the next twelve years releasing studio, live, and side-project albums. Gira's frustration with various record labels grew over time, and he disbanded Swans in 1997. However, in 2010, Gira decided to revive the band, with members new and old. They released a new album titled My Father Will Guide Me Up a Rope to the Sky. A second post-revival album, The Seer, was released in 2012. A third, To Be Kind, was released in 2014. All three were met with increasing critical acclaim. The Glowing Man followed and was released in June 2016. The band's latest album, Leaving Meaning, was released in 2019."

Normally, HMAS Canberra and HMAS Adelaide would be deployed; however, propulsion issues with the two vessels kept them docked for repairs.
